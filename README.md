"# CNN-droneracing-Poly" 
This project consists in training a convolutional neural network for artificial vision for an autonomous racing drone.
There are 5 python files in total:
- data_manip.py: This one contains functions for data pre-processing and datasets generation.
- model.py: This file contains all relevant functions for creating the model, for training the model and for evaluating the model.
- show_result.py: This file has functions for saving the model and plotting the training results.
- training.py: This file contains all the functions necessary for the training process (think of it as containing the tools for training the model).
- main.py: This is the main file of the project which brings the 4 previous files together to prepare the datasets, create the CNN, train it and evaluate it. You'll have to replace the directory path with your own. That root directory path needs to contain the images for the datasets.

There is also a folder containing the training data that was used.

Do note that this is just part of the whole project which involves implementing this algorithm to the drone.
